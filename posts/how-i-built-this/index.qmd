As usual, I was wandering around, pondering what might be the best option for my needs.

Despite diving deep into analysis paralysis and juggling a few options such as raw HTML, Jekyll, Mermaid, and Quarto, I finally settled on one.

## Why Choose Quarto for Blogging?

So, why did I choose Quarto? Here are my reasons:

* **Jeremy Howard's Influence**: I've always admired [Jeremy Howard on Twitter](https://twitter.com/jeremyphoward). On exploring nbdev, I discovered it was deprecated, leading me to Quarto.
* **Hands-on Learning Advocacy**: My goal is for this platform to extend beyond mere text, enabling readers to interact with live code snippets.
* **Markdown Compatibility**: Quarto's integration with the familiar markdown format streamlines content creation.
* **Jupyter Notebook Integration**: Regularly working with Jupyter notebooks, Quarto's capability to convert them into blog posts resonated with my workflow.
* **Feature-Rich Platform**: Dive deeper into Quarto's offerings [here](https://quarto.org/).

## How to Build an Interactive Blog with Quarto

I won't reinvent the wheel here. Instead, I'll guide you to Quarto's detailed and user-friendly tutorial on setting up a blog:

* [Creating a Quarto Blog](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html)
* Deploying your creation? I opted for GitHub Pages, and Quarto's guide made the transition effortless: [Deploying with GitHub Pages](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html).
