Iâ€™m currently pursuing an MSc in Computer Science and am deeply committed to self-education.\nGuess what? I recently got myself a new PC!\nIn the professional realm, Iâ€™m delving into model adaptation, RAG, and LLMâ€™s. And, recently some speech recognition.\nWhen Iâ€™m not geeking out on tech, I enjoy watching dramas and psychological thrillers. Iâ€™ve decided to start this blog for personal reasons â€” itâ€™s high time I have an output for all the inputs I consume. Plus, Iâ€™d love to share some cool stuff with you. Stay tuned!\nFeel free to drop a message. Iâ€™m eager to be part of a this vibrant community."
