Hey, I'm Christian from Costa Rica ðŸ‘‹. 
I'm an enthusiast who loves computers and occasionally builds things. I'm currently pursuing an MSc in Computer Science and am deeply committed to self-education.

Guess what? I recently got myself a new PC!

In the professional realm, I'm delving into model adaptation, RAG, and LLM's. And, recently some
speech recognition.

When I'm not geeking out on tech, I enjoy watching dramas and psychological thrillers. I've decided to start this blog for personal reasons â€” it's high time I have an output for all the inputs I consume. Plus, I'd love to share some cool stuff with you. Stay tuned!

Feel free to drop a message. I'm eager to be part of a this vibrant community.
